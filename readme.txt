Inbox helps your team collaborate on emails together. Now get Inbox’s team email and contact form right inside your Wordpress.

== Description ==

Inbox by Zendesk is a free, lightweight web app designed for teams to easily collaborate on shared and group email addresses.

Teams using Inbox improve their internal communication behind-the-scenes on shared emails with features like assigning and @mentioning. By creating a single place for internal and external email communication, teams work faster and with more clarity than ever before.  The mobile-first web app works across every browser and device.

#### How Teams Use Inbox ####
* Talk among yourselves
	* Emails bounce between clients, partners, and your team.  Inbox makes sure none of those conversations get lost in the abyss.

* Respond as one
	* Work as a team to manage a marketing campaign, or any other influx of email.  Make sure every bit of feedback is heard - and responded to promptly.

* Be there for your people
	* Take part in every conversation - questions sent to hello@company.com, fixes and updates sent to webmaster@company.com or general feedback sent to the team. 

#### Key Features of the Plugin: ####
* Easy to deploy contact form
	* Integrate the Inbox web widget on your website in just one click, and allow your customers to effortlessly find a way to contact you.

* Inbox in your Wordpress panel
	* Now your web marketers, blog authors and wordpress admins can access Inbox right inside Wordpress. No need to keep another tab open to communicate with the rest of your team.

* It’s a mobile world
	* The plugin and contact form are designed mobile-first, so they look great on any device for your web visitors and anyone accessing your Wordpress panel.

#### Discover the Inbox Features ####
* Email sorted
	* Inbox organizes your team’s emails, so there’s no question about ownership.  Assign an email to yourself, or delegate to a team member. 

* Working together
	* Team members collaborate behind the scenes within the customer’s email thread. Exchange knowledge in a single place and come to a consensus before your reply.

* Inline notifications
	* Share information with your teammates by @mentioning them in your internal team notes. They’ll be notified via email, browser, or iOS push notification.

Review from Oliver at WPLift

> “This is my kind of app – it’s super clean and easy to use, the interface is minimal and well designed and the front end form is also nicely designed. The functionality it brings to your customer email support is great if you have a few team members. I can see this working for teams to provide customer support as well as being used internally when working on projects. Being able to assign emails to specific team members is great along with being able to tag people and leave private comments only viewable by staff.”
